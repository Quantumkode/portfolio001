      <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
      <p>
        At [Your Name or Company], we strive to provide the highest quality
        services in website development and digital solutions. We understand
        that there may be instances where our services do not meet your
        expectations, and in such cases, we offer refunds under the following
        conditions:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Eligibility for Refunds</h3>
      <p>
        Refunds will be considered only in the following cases:
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the project has not yet commenced or no deliverables have been
            provided within the agreed time frame.
          </li>
          <li>
            If there are significant deviations from the initially agreed
            project scope without client approval.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the client is not satisfied with the initial design or
            development phase, provided that no substantial work has been
            completed beyond that point.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>2. Non-Refundable Cases</h3>
      <p>
        Refunds will not be granted in the following situations:
        <ul>
          <li>
            After the final product or service has been delivered and approved
            by the client.
          </li>
          <li>
            If delays or issues arise due to incomplete or insufficient
            information provided by the client.
          </li>
          <li>
            If third-party services or tools (e.g., hosting, domain
            registration) have been purchased on behalf of the client, as these
            are non-refundable.
          </li>
        </ul>
